### **3.4. Screen Mockups**
![alt text](images/Flow_diagram.png)

### **3.5. Non-Functional Requirements**
<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **Entry Encryption**
    - **Description**: User entries will be stored in an external database encrypted with AES protocol
    - **Justification**: Encrypting user data as an extra layer of security will make more people willing to choose our application to save all of their sensitive personal information. Protecting this information is also extremely important from a privacy/ethics point of view, along with for the safety of users as well.
2. **Response Times**
    - **Description**: 
        - Operations for managing journal entries should be completed within 2 seconds when the server is available.
        - Sentiment analysis API should take within 20 seconds.
        - Chat bot responses should be fetched within 5 seconds.
    - **Justification**: Fast response times are crucial for a smooth user experience. Waiting a maximum of 5 seconds for a prompt for writing sounds reasonable along with max 20 seconds for analysis to be done after an entry is created as it will already take some time for the user to navigate to the menu if they wanted to see progress tracking of the app. For operations involving journal entries, people will probably want something a bit more responsive since they might want to look through multiple past journal entries.

3. **Usability**
    - **Description**: 
        - Operations for users managing journal entries should take less than 3 clicks.
    - **Justification**: Minimizing the number of clicks required to perform operations makes it so that the user can get to adding or viewing journal entries quickly so that people who are more impulsive for entries are more likely to remain consistent with journaling.

    - **Interfaces**: 
        1. GET /api/authenticate
            - **Request Parameters**: Credential (Google email and password)
            - **Response Body**: Login status
2. **Stripe - Third-party payment**
    - **Purpose**: Manage a secure payment transactions using Stripe. 
    - **Rationale**: Stripe has developer-friendly APIs and is easy to learn. The alternative was Paypal which is supposedly less flexible for developers.
    - **Interfaces**: The Stripe API is integrated in the Treasury component of our app, with logic to update the user database if the server webhook receives a payment succeeded event.
3. **Sentiment Analysis - Openai API**
    - **Purpose**: Analyzes user's journal entry to determine sentiment.
    - **Rationale**: Most of the group has used the openai API previously. It is very simple to learn as well. 
    - **Interfaces**:
        1. POST /api/sentiment
            - **Request Body**: journal entry
            - **Response Body**: Sentiment score
4. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) - Reminder System**
    - **Purpose**: Sends push notifications to remind users about journal entries.
    - **Rationale**: Firebase Cloud Messaging is free and easy to integrate with both Android and backend services.
    - **Interfaces**: The FCM is integrated in the User component of our app, with /api/profile and /api/profile/reminder to sent when a user sets a reminder for journal entries. The reminder is triggered based on user's device time's selected days and time preferences stored in the database in both server time and user time.
        

### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **Docker**
    - **Purpose**: Automate the deployment of our application
    - **Reason**: Enables easy deployment across different environments without dependency issues.
2. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Store user and journaling data
    - **Reason**: We choose to use MongoDB because it is a NoSQL database, which allows flexible storage of semi-structured journal data. We also worked with it during CPEN322/CPEN320, so all group members are familiar with it.
3. **AWS EC2**
    - **Purpose**: Cloud hosting
    - **Reason**: Enables scalable and cost-effective for hosting backend services. It is also introduced in our tutorial, so all group members are familiar with it.
4. **RASA**
    - **Purpose**: Chatbot for guided journaling.
    - **Reason**: Enables structured journaling by dynamically adjusting responses based on user input.

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. **Encryption of Entries**
    - **Planned Implementation**: We will use AES-256-CBC encryption protocol to ensure all entires in the database are only viewable by the user who wrote them. A server-wide secret will act as the salt for key derivation, ensuring consistency across encryption and decryption processes. When a user needs to add or modify entries, the encryption key will be derived again from their Google Numeric ID and the server secret. The encrypted data, including the IV, will be stored in the database. During decryption, the IV is extracted from the stored data, allowing successful retrieval of the original content.


2. **Performance**
    - **Planned Implementation**: Using https to MongoDB, we can receive and transmit simple text, image and video (or database operations that surround these things), at a rate that will match. 
    For sentiment analysis, because there are multiple sentiments along with multiple variables that need to be tracked, the openai API will be used to compute weights for different emotions to later display in the "sentiment summary" screen.
    For prompting the user, we will use the SARA framework to customize our own chatbot LLM to analyze and follow a set flow of conversation and to log activities that the user reports throughout the day for statistics tracking. Using this framework will allow us to be more flexible in that it can be run much faster than an external API call.

3. **Usability**
    - **Planned Implementation**: We will make sure the buttons design flow will be within 3 click. The user would click on the entry from calendar activity, which would take the user to the entry view activity. Then the user would do their final click of manage entry to get access to the entry. Please refer to the Screen Mockups for a detailed view.


### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
- **Description**: 
        Based On a custom trained chatbot that is designed to guide users through structured journal entries by dynamically adjusting its questions based on user responses. 
        It ensures that entries are meaningful, complete, and well-organized by leveraging Rasa NLU for intent classification and dialogue management.
        The chatbot must also integrate with sentiment analysis and the backend database to store journal entries.
- **Why complex?**: 
        Requires custom NLP training to recognize user intent accurately.
        Must handle custom dialogue management, adapting dynamically to different user responses.
        Needs context retention, meaning it must remember user input across multiple conversation turns.
        Requires error handling and fallback mechanisms to manage incomplete or unclear entries.
        Must integrate with sentiment analysis models to analyze the emotional tone of journal entries.
        Requires secure and efficient storage integration with the backend for saving journal entries.

- **Design**:
    - **Input**: 
        Userâ€™s journal entry responses (text or speech-to-text), 
    - **Output**: 
        A structured journal entry stored in the database.
        A sentiment score attached to the journal entry for analytics.
    - **Main computational logic**:
        Intent Classification: Determine user response category emotion, intent.
        Dialogue Management: Adjust responses and next questions dynamically in real time.
        Context Retention: Maintain conversational context and Memory across user interactions.
        Sentiment Analysis: Compute sentiment scores after post entry/completion.
        Backend Storage: Save structured journal entries to the database along with sentiment score.
    - **Pseudo-code**: 
        ```python
        def startEntry():
            # Initialize Journaling Session
            sessionData = {
                "mood": None,
                "sleep": None,
                "exercise": None,
                "stress": None,
                "goal": None,
                "socialInteraction": None,
                "sentimentScore": None,
            }

            # Step 1: Greet The User
            chatbot.say("Hi! How are you doing today, ready for your daily journaling?")
            response = user_input()

            if intent(response) in ["goodbye"]:
                chatbot.say("See you tomorrow! Bye!")
                return

            # Step 2: Ask about Mood
            chatbot.ask("How is your mood today? Yesterday you weren't all that feeling great.")
            sessionData["mood"] = user_input()

            # Step 3: Ask about sleep
            chatbot.ask("How much sleep did you get last night?")
            sessionData["sleep"] = user_input()

            # Step 4: Ask about exercise
            chatbot.ask("Did you get in exercise for the day?")
            sessionData["exercise"] = user_input()

            # Step 5: Ask about stress levels
            chatbot.ask("Is your stress level low, medium, or high?")
            sessionData["stress"] = user_input()

            # Step 6: Ask about goals for the day
            chatbot.ask("What do you want to accomplish today?")
            sessionData["goal"] = user_input()

            # Step 7: Ask about social interactions for the day
            chatbot.ask("Did you have any meaningful social interactions with anyone for the day?")
            sessionData["goal"] = user_input()

            # Step 7: Provide a summary
            chatbot.say("Here's your daily journaling log:\n" +
                        "- Mood: " + sessionData['mood'] + "\n" +
                        "- Sleep: " + sessionData['sleep'] + " hours\n" +
                        "- Exercise: " + sessionData['exercise'] + " hours\n" +
                        "- Stress: " + sessionData['stress'] + "\n" +
                        "- Goal: " + sessionData['goal'] + "\n" +
                        "- Social Interaction: " + sessionData['socialInteraction'])

            #Step 8: Save To DB
            entry = {
                "userName": userName,
                "date": getDate(),
                "mood": sessionData["mood"],
                "sleep": sessionData["sleep"],
                "exercise": sessionData["exercise"],
                "stress": sessionData["stress"],
                "goal": sessionData["goal"],
                "socialInteraction": sessionData["socialInteraction"],
                "sentimentScore": sentimentScore
            }
            saveToDB(entry)
