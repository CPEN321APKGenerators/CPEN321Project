#### 10. Reflections on Generative AI Technologies
Reflections on using Generative AI technologies for software engineering tasks. You must answer
and elaborate on all the following questions in 1-2 paragraphs each:
    a. Which Generative AI technologies did you use in the scope of this course?
    b. For which phases of the overall Software Engineering process and which concrete tasks
    in these phases was Generative AI the most helpful and why? Discuss phases such as
    requirements elicitation and documentation, design, implementation, code review, testing,
    and project refinement (for the final release).
    c. For which phases of the overall Software Engineering process and which concrete tasks
    in these phases was Generative AI the least helpful and why? Discuss phases such as
    requirements elicitation and documentation, design, implementation, code review, testing,
    and project refinement (for the final release).
    d. Is there anything else you would like to share about AI’s impact on your software
    engineering tasks?
