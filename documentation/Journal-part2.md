2. The link to your GitHub repository and the commit SHA of your final released version (which should
be on the main/master branch).
3. The locations of your front-end and back-end tests in the repository.
4. The manufacturer and model of a physical device your app is running on (not an emulator).
5. A public IP of your back-end server and its domain name (if any).
6. All necessary user accounts or similar details we need to run your app
7. Which use cases implement your “complexity” idea and how. Please refer to the complexity idea
defined in your requirements and design document.
8. “Humblebrag”: a description of any technical extra part of your project you are particularly proud of.
9. A list of limitations of your project.
10. Reflections on using Generative AI technologies for software engineering tasks. You must answer
and elaborate on all the following questions in 1-2 paragraphs each:
    a. Which Generative AI technologies did you use in the scope of this course?
    b. For which phases of the overall Software Engineering process and which concrete tasks
    in these phases was Generative AI the most helpful and why? Discuss phases such as
    requirements elicitation and documentation, design, implementation, code review, testing,
    and project refinement (for the final release).
    c. For which phases of the overall Software Engineering process and which concrete tasks
    in these phases was Generative AI the least helpful and why? Discuss phases such as
    requirements elicitation and documentation, design, implementation, code review, testing,
    and project refinement (for the final release).
    d. Is there anything else you would like to share about AI’s impact on your software
    engineering tasks?
