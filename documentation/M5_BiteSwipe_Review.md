## 1. Manual code review
a. Code is well documented, good variable names, efficient, no bad design smells,
correct error handling: x/10
## 2. Manual test review
a. Tests are complete (all APIs exposed to the frontend are tested, three main use cases
are tested), errors and edge cases are thoroughly tested, correct assertions are used:
x/10
b. Tests implementation matches the requirements and design: x/10
c. Tests are well-structured: x/10
d. Tests are comprehensive (good coverage): x/10
e. Non-functional requirements are tested well: x/10
f. All backend tests can be run automatically: x/10
## 3. Automated code review
a. Codacy runs with the required setup: x/10
b. All remaining Codacy issues are well-justified: x/10
## 4. Fault: report one major implementation issue you found in your peer-team app. The report
should contain the details about the issue (with screenshots) and the severity of the issue
- Issues that can be easily found with automated tools, like Codacy, ChatGPT, etc.
are not considered major. Look for deep “semantic” issues that require human
intelligence.
- Yes, you will find some major issues – there is no app without issues a few weeks
before the final deadline
- If you report that you cannot find any major fault and then a TA does, you will lose
marks. Otherwise, you will be given the full mark
